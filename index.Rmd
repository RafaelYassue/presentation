# Goals

+ Develop a pipeline to integrate phenomics data into GWAS framework

+ Employ multi-phenotype GWAS, PheWAS, and gene annotation  in order to identify possible candidate genes to pleiotropic effects 

+ Identify candidate phenotypes responsible for changes in the hyperspectral reflectance

---
class: animated, fadeIn
# Materials and Methods
+ Phenotypes:
  - Manually measured phenotypes: 
     * Plant height (PH)
     * Stalk diameter (SD) 
     * Shoot dry mass (SDM)
  - Hyperspectral phenotypes: 
     * 150 wavelengths (from 386 to 1021 nm)
     * 131 hyperspectral index

+ Bayesian GWAS
  - BayesC 
  - $\pi$ = 0.99
  - Model frequency 

+ Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS)

---
class: animated, fadeIn
# BayesC
In order to estimate the markers effect and  variance components, the following model were used for each combination of phenotype and management (B+ and B-):

` \begin{align*}
%\label{eq1}
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{1}\mu + \mathbf{X}_{1}\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{X}_{2}\mathbf{b} +   \mathbf{Z}_{1}\mathbf{m}+ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
\end{align*}` 

`\begin{align*}
m_{k} | \pi, \sigma^{2}_{mk}  = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{ with probability of } \pi \\
\sim N (0, \sigma^{2}_{mk}) & \text{ with probability } (1 - \pi)
\end{cases}
\end{align*}` 
and $\pi$ = 0.99.

class: animated, fadeIn

# Bivariate models
In order to estimate the genetic correlation between manually measured and hyperspectral traits, we performed bivariate BayesC analysis using the same model described above but the vector $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector containing the a manually measured and a hyperspectral phenotypes; $\mathbf{g}$ $\sim$ N (0, $\Sigma_{g} \otimes \mathbf{M}$) and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ $\sim$ N (0, $\Sigma_{\epsilon} \otimes \mathbf{I}$) the residual;  $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product;and $\Sigma_{g}$ and $\Sigma_{\epsilon}$ are the variance-covariance matrices for additive genomic and residual effects taking the forms of

` \begin{align*}
\Sigma_{g} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^{2}_{g_1}  & \sigma_{g_{12}} \\  \sigma_{g_{21}} & \sigma^{2}_{g_{2}}  \end{bmatrix}, \hspace{0.2cm}
\Sigma_{\epsilon} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^{2}_{\epsilon_{1}}  & \sigma_{\epsilon_{12}} \\  \sigma_{\epsilon_{21}} & \sigma^{2}_{\epsilon_{2}}  \end{bmatrix},   
\end{align*}` 

where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the first and second phenotypes.
